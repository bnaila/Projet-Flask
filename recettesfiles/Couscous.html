			<h5>Preparing semolina with raisins (steamed)<h5> </br>
	
Note: For the semolina there is a faster way to cook your semolina (the recipe you find in the couscous box), personally I prefer the traditional cooking method (longer) but the semolina is more airy, and it digests better.</br>

			1st stage</br>
			For the semolina, the raisins, then 3 tablespoons of olive oil into a large container, then gradually pour in, mixing with a wooden spoon, the equivalent of 25 cl of warm salted water. , then grind the semolina by hand (as if you were rubbing your hands) this avoids the formation of lumps;
			Cook for 20 minutes;</br>
			2nd stage</br>
			After 20 minutes pour the semolina into your container and start by shelling your semolina with a wooden spoon, then pour another 25 cl of cold water gradually, then shell the semolina by hand when it has cooled down ;
			Steam for another 15 minutes and repeat phase 2 once more;
			To finish, pour the semolina into your container, add 50 grams of butter that you let melt on your semolina, fluff it when it has cooled down and your semolina is ready!
